After more than ten years working as a Web/Graphic Designer/Developer in either private, public or foreign companies, I've come to enjoy sharing my skills within the IT field as either a creative UX/UI force or a Graphic-driven developer. I handle both fields with dominance and ease.

- ⚡ Vast experience wire framing, designing & articulating websites from scratch. Knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS/JQ and php languages, among others.

I created my own HTML Framework that i continually develop. Additionally I get along with the industry's top picks like Bootstrap and Foundation, sometimes I use underdogs like Skeleton or W3. I can proficiently manage Wordpress, Blogger or other blog-related frameworks. 

I've also worked with Opencart, Shopify, Magento, Joomla!, Drupal, etc.

HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Jquery, Less, Sass… anything that could save me time and effort to code a little bit more.

I can swim nicely through MVC waters, I do some frontend-related PHP and JS, and I can also manage a server for light-weighted websites, blogs or databases. I am starting to like React, Vue or Angular stuff too.

Either as a Freelance Unicorn or a Home office employee, I've conquered the at-distance-cyberspace thanks to apps like GitHub, BitBucket, Asana, Confluence, Invision, Sketch, etc.

Filezilla, XAMPP, MAMP, VirtualBox, FFMPEG, LibreOffice, OpenOffice, OBS… (pheew) Let's just say I spend a ridiculous amount of time in front of a PC.
